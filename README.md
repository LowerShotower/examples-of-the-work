Ways of visualisation:
1.Visualisation with the help of the arrays can be used.
2.Depending on score of the user, string of equal simbols will be generated (///). So every round have list of symbols, bigger score, longer string of symbols.
3.Rounded Charts. center of the circle is 0 points. each round(puzzle game) is a ray from center. each person is the dot on the way from center to the border of the circle.
4. Each game is a line with the list of users' names. Every name changes its color depending on points, earned in the game. from 0 points (violet) to 150 points (red)
